      <h3>Do you remember your very first presentation?</h3>
      <p>Maybe you were nervous and wished to speak with more self-confidence, or to answer questions with more certainty.</p>
      <p>And today, after years of work experience, you still get agitated, when having to speak and wish for more security in your presentations?</p>
      <p>No matter how your beginnings looked like, we will start at the base and will make sure that you will not only be successful but also satisfied with any presentation you will give.</p>

      <h3>Your body will always communicate</h3>
      <h4>You just have to make it say the same thing you do</h4>
      <p>If your body language is giving a completely different story, it doesn’t matter how genius your ideas are, because they won’t arrive in the minds of the people listening to you.</p>
      <p>With the Presentation Project I want to help you to <span class="accent">fully develop your impact</span> during your presentations, that one super important pitch, but also in your everyday life.</p>

        <ul class="program__block">
          <li>
            Interaction as a team

      <p>Due to the many playful elements from improvisational
        theater, this offer is also perfect as a <span class="accent">team building event</span>.
        Alternatively, we can place the emphasis on one of the other

      <h3>Esther Tchlakichvili</h3>
      <p>Having grown up with theater, singing and dancing, I add a <span class="accent">creative touch</span> to everything I do.</p>
      <p>Be it with the slightly different presentations that were met with great enthusiasm in my <span class="accent">teaching studies</span>, or with fresh ideas when writing ad copy that you can't stop reading.</p>
      <p>I applied this talent to <span class="accent">educational work</span> with groups of young people and adults, when conceptualizing international art camps, or designing and executing creative projects in educational institutions.</p>
      <p>Later I worked as a <span class="accent">copywriter</span> in two marketing agencies and designed the textual appearance for various major clients from different fields. In my spare time, I organize and conceptualize exhibitions and conduct <span class="accent">art performances</span>.</p>
      <p>With this unique mixture of educational work, marketing experience and creativity, I can also help you find more self-confidence in your presentations and to <span class="accent">convince everyone of you and your idea</span>.</p>
